As a computer science student with a passion for web development, I recently decided to give my personal website a much-needed facelift. After careful consideration and research, I settled on using Hugo, a popular static site generator, to revamp my website and take better care of it.

With Hugo, I found it surprisingly easy to whip up a new site from scratch. The documentation and community support for Hugo were extensive, making the learning curve relatively manageable. I chose a sleek and modern theme that suited my style and vision for my website.

The first step was to install Hugo and set up a new project directory. I quickly realized that Hugo's command-line interface (CLI) made it incredibly convenient to create new content pages, configure layouts, and customize my site's appearance. The flexibility of Hugo's templating language allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web pages with ease.

I spent hours meticulously tweaking the theme, fine-tuning the layout, and customizing the color scheme to match my personal branding. I also took the opportunity to optimize the site's performance by compressing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and enabling caching.

As a computer science student, I was particularly fascinated by Hugo's underlying technology. It uses a static site generator approach, where web pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML files. This eliminates the need for complex server-side processing and databases, resulting in faster load times and improved security.

As I worked on my website, I also gained a deeper understanding of web development concepts such as version control using Git, optimizing for search engines (SEO), and ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities. I took the time to thoroughly test my website across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and seamless user experience.

One of the most rewarding aspects of updating my website was the newfound sense of ownership and pride. I now feel more confident in showcasing my work and achievements, knowing that my website is a reflection of my professionalism and attention to detail.

Going forward, I plan to regularly update my website with new projects, blog posts, and other relevant content. I am also considering the possibility of writing my own static site generator in the future, as I am inspired by the simplicity and efficiency of this approach to web development.
