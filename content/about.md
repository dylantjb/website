Hello! I am a second-year computer science student at King's College London, with a passion for both artificial intelligence and software engineering. I believe that the intersection of these two fields holds immense potential for driving innovation and solving complex problems.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a solid foundation in software engineering and development. I have taken modules that have exposed me to various programming languages, software development methodologies, and design principles. I have actively participated in group projects, honing my skills in collaborative coding, version control, and project management. I take pride in the results achieved through these group efforts and have been able to apply theoretical concepts to real-world software development scenarios.

One aspect of software engineering that has greatly intrigued me is the world of open source software. I have been exploring the underpinnings of Linux software, understanding the inner workings of the Linux operating system and contributing to open source projects. I believe that open source software promotes collaboration and innovation, and I am committed to leveraging its power to create meaningful and impactful software solutions.

I have also delved into the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence during my studies. I have gained insights into machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision. I am intrigued by the potential of AI to transform industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, and I am excited to continue my exploration in this field.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an active member of the King's AI Society and the KCL Tech Society. I attend guest speaker events, workshops, and hackathons, where I gain insights into different branches of technology, including artificial intelligence and software engineering. These experiences have helped me broaden my horizons and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

In conclusion, as a second-year computer science student at King's College London, I am passionate about both artificial intelligence and software engineering. I have been actively engaged in exploring the underpinnings of Linux software, contributing to open source projects, and participating in group work and events organized by the King's AI Society and KCL Tech Society. I am eager to continue my journey of learning, growing, and contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology.
